# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
**The given dataset contains marketing data of a bank and the sample dataset is provided by Azure at:
https://automlsamplenotebookdata.blob.core.windows.net/automl-sample-notebook-data/bankmarketing_train.csv

Best Performing Model: In this given dataset, 


**In 1-2 sentences, explain the solution: e.g. "The best performing model was a ..."**

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
(i) Data is loaded as a very first step, which is imported from TabularDatasetFactory. (ii) Data cleaning: Hot encoding 
was used as columns have categorical data.  (iii)Data split was used as 0.7:0.3 for traning and testing datasets respectively
(iv)Hyperparameters were chosen with Random Sampling and regression models were used for traning with hyperparameters (C, max_iter)
(v) once the experiment is completed, BanditPolicy was used for early termination. This was we can save further use of resources by
stopping the hyperparameter run. (vi)  using hyperparametrs, the best model was observed and then saved

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
